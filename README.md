# deno-oak-inngest-handler
[Inngest][] is the developer platform for easily building reliable workflows with zero infrastructure.

This repo includes an implementation of the [Serve Handler][] to support [Deno][] + [Oak][].

Do not be alarmed! The .env is commited but does not include any sensitive info. This is included to demonstrate Inngest setup and to allow for a fully functional sample.

It is recommended that you use the [Inngest Local Development][] flow when testing this repo.
